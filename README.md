## What is Go?
Go (a.k.a., Golang) is a programming language first developed at Google. It is a statically-typed language with syntax loosely derived from C, but with additional features such as garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types (e.g., variable-length arrays and key-value maps), and a large standard library.

### How to use this image
Note: `/go` is world-writable to allow flexibility in the user which runs the container (for example, in a container started with `--user 1000:1000`, running `go get github.com/example/...` into the default `$GOPATH` will succeed). While the `777` directory would be insecure on a regular host setup, there are not typically other processes or users inside the container, so this is equivalent to `700` for Docker usage, but allowing for `--user` flexibility.
